Types of variables:
their are 3 types of variable local,instance and static

Class Vars{
int age=10;                   //instance variable
static double weight=25.5;    //static variable
   void method(){
  String name="Moreed";       //local variable
  }
  }

  1)Local variables:
  If variable is defined inside a method or loop or any other block of code it is called local variable.

  2)Instance variable:
  If a variable is not declared inside a method but it is inside a class then it is called instance variable.

  3)Static variable:
  if a variable is not declared inside a method but it is inside a class and it has static keyword
  with it then is called a static variable

  Local variables:
  Local variables should always be preferred over instance and static variables why because
  they occupy the computer memory for very very short amount of time
  as soon as their purpose is served Java destroys them
  Pros:
  save memory
  cons:
  not accessible outside of methods/block of code
  Instance variable:
  When we want to share something in multiple methods of a class and
  the information is expected to be different from object to object we should go with instance variable
  Pros:
  accessible in all the methods of a class
  Cons:
  occupy the computer memory for longer than local variable

  Static variable:
  when we know that information will same for all the objects of the class we should create a static variable for that
  Pros:
  single memory location for all objects of the class
  Cons:
  stay longer in the memory can hold only one value at a time.
