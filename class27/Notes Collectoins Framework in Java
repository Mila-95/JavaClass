Collections Framework in Java:
Collections of classes that help us manage and manipulate data in batter way.
1)Arraylist class
  1)This class has many built-in methods like add(), remove(), clear(), etc...
  2)Dynamic and can adjust their size at run time.
  ArrayList<String> arrayList=new ArrayList<>();
  ArrayList --> name of the class
  <> --> diamond operator we specify the data type that we will be storing inside
  Wrapper classes
  byte  --> Byte
  short --> Shor
  int   --> Integer
  double--> Double
  Why we have wrapper clasess
  1)we get bult -in method
  2)a lot og frameworks don't support primitives
  When to use primitives:
  When we care about the memory because primitives occupy 4 time less memorry
  as compered to wrapper
  2)performance
  When we can use Wrapper
  When we care about our ease.
  Difference boxing and unboxing converting a primitive
  boxing primitive -> wrapper unboxing wrapper ->primitive
  //converting to primitive is boxing
  // converting from wrapper to primitive is unboxing
