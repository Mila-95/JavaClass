Inheritance in Java:
Its a mechanism in Java trough which a child class gets the properties and methods for parent class

Benefits: Whu do we need to use inheritance
  1)Save time to code
  2)code duplication is reduced
  3)execution time is faster

DisAdvantages:
Classes are tightly coupled if we changer something in parent class it is also changed in the child class.
  Types of inheritance
  There are for tupes of inheritance but java only support 3 of them
 1)Single
 2)Hierarchical
 3)multilevel
 4)Multiple(not supported in Java)
 Single inheritance we have only one child and one parent class or only 2 classes participate in inheritance
 one as child one as parent.
 Class Parent{
 }
 class Child extends Parent{
 }
 Hierarchical:
 In Hierarchical inheritence we have a single Parent class and multiple child classes
 class Parent{
 }
 class1 Child1 extend Patent{
 }
 class Child2 extend Parent{
 }
 Multilevel:
 We have multiple levels of inheritance for example if we have classes A B C
 class C will be inherited from B and B will be inherited from A
 Class A{
 }
 Class B extend A{
 }
Class C extend B{
}
================================================================================================
Super Keyword:
super keyword is like the "this" it refers to the parent class object for example we can access the file methods
 or constructors of parent class inside the child class suing this keyword.
