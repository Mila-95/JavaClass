Set in Java:
  Set is an interface in collections frame work witch is implemented by many classes for example
  HashSet,LinkedHashSet and TreeSet.

Properties of Set:
  All the Sets don't allow duplicates

HashSet:
  1.HashSet set does not maintain the insertion order
  2.It is the fastest in all Sets
  3.Most widely used Set.

LinkedHashSet:
   1.Maintains the insertion order
   2.Slower then HashSet but faster than TreeSet specially in insertion

TreeSet:
1.Sort the data in natural order.For number in increasing order
2.Is is slowest when it comes to store the data.

When to use which type of Set:
1.If we don't care about insertion order and data being sorted always use HashSet
2.If we need the insertion order we don't have much choice we have to use key LinkedHashSet
But if we don't care about insertion order we can compare it with TreeSet

     LinkedHashSet               Vs            TreeSet
  Insertion is ot slow                       Slowest insertion
  Retrieval is super super slow              Slower than HashSet but faster then LinkedHashSet

interwiev questions
I don't care about insertion order but a care about retrieval speed which Set i should use?
HashSet.
I don't care about insertion order and i  don't care about retrieval speed which Set i should use?
LinkedHashSet.
I want to have stored data all the time?
TreeSet
