Inheritance in Java:
This is a mechanism in Java with one class can acquire the properties and methods from another class
The class from which we acquire the properties parent/superClass/baseClass and the class
which acquire this properties and methods is called Child class/ derived class/subclass

        Advantages:
  1)Code duplications is reduced.
  2)Saves Memory.
  3)execution time is less.

        Disadvantages:
  Classes get tightly coupled.If we change something in the parent class it will effect all the
  children classes and we have to make sure that this new changes is compatible with the
  code that we have in the children class.

        When we should use Inheritance:
If there is a case in which we would have to use the same methods in many classes and classes are
closely repleted  to each other and the best practice would be to create a parent class and use it
 to extend the methods into the subclasses for example Cat class and Dog class.

        Types of inheritance:
     We have 4 types of inheritance
  1)Single  (We hawe only one parent and only one child class)
  Example:
class Animal{
  String name;
  String colour;
  int age; double weight;
  }
class Dog extends Animal{
 }
  2)Hierarchical ( in hierarchical we have only one parent class and multiple children classes)
  Example:
class Animal{
    String name;
    String colour;
    int age; double weight;
    }
class Dog extends Animal{
     }
class cat extends Animal{
     }

  3)Multilevel (if we have one parent and one child class and many intermediate classes it is called Multilevel)
  Example:
class Human{
String name;

}
 class Employee extends Human{
 String employersId;
}
class Teacher extends Employee{
String subject;
}

  4)Multiply (we have a single class and multiple parent classes)
class Display{
int resolution;
}
class Keyboard{
int noOfKeys;
}
class Laptop extends Display,Keyboard{

}
Rules:
1)Private member are not inherited (private fields and private methods)
2)Constructor don't participate in inheritance
3)If we have a constructor in the parent class we must have it a matching constructor in the child class as well
4)In Java a subclass can only extend one single parent class

Super Keyword:
Super keyword is a reference variable that we can use to access the fields or methods or constructor of the parent class.
1)if we have same name in the parent class and in the child class we can to use super keyword to prefer to the
 parent class field as by default   java prefers the instance field of the child class
2)we can use the supper keyword to call the method of the parent class if we have the same  name method in the child
class as well.
3)we can use super with() to call the parent class constructor.

Overloading in Java:

When same method name exist in the class with different number of parameters or with different type
of parameters or with different sequence of parameters.

Advantages of overloading:
1)More readable code.
2)Code id easier to use.
3)Flexible code.
4)We can have polymorphism with the help of method overloading.

When to overload a method:
If methods are performing same operations but with different parameters then we should overload these methods.
Rules:
1)Method name should be same.
2)Method signature (method name + parameter list) should be different.
3)We cant overload a method by just changing its return type.
4)We cant overload a method by just changing its access modifier(public private etc).
5)We cant overload a method by just changing its  non access modifier(static final etc).
6)We can overload static method and main method as well.
