Types of variable: Class17 Recap
There are 3 types of variables local.instance and static
local variables:
The variables that are declared inside a method or block of code are called local variable
Pros:
Save memory
Cons:
Limited access can not be accessed outside of methods or block of code where they are declered.
Instance variables:
The variable which are declared inside a class but outside of a method or block of code are called instance variables.
Pros:
Instance variables are accessible in all the methods of the class
Cons:
They occupy the computers memory for longer as compared to local variables
static variables:
if instance variable have the static keyword with them they are called static variables.
Pros:
Single memory location for all the objects of that class.
Cons:
Can hold only one value for all the objects and stays even longer inside the memory then instance variable
=========================================================================================================
Access modifiers;
Access modifiers are keywords in Java that defines from a certain variable method  or a class can be accessed

Their a re 4 types of accesses in Java that we can define using three keywords
1)Private
2)Protected
3)public

Types of access are 4
1)Private
2)Default(applied when no keyword is used)
3)Protected
4)Public
Private access (keyword is private).
When we use the private keyword with any of the variable method or classes these can only be
accessed with in that class.
Default access(applied when we don't know use any keyword Java to those variables methods or classes etc.
which means these this things can only be accessed from the same package.
Protected access(We use the protected class)
When protected access is applied class members (variable methods etc.)can be accessed
from other packages but only in the classes that participate in inheritance
public assess(public keyword);
public means class member and classes can be accessed from anywhere inside that project.
