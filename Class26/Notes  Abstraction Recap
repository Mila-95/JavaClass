7)What is Abstraction? How can we
achieve an Abstraction in Java? What is
Interface? What is Abstract Class?
Interface vs Abstract Class?

Abstraction in Java means Hiding the
implementation details and providing
the functionality only.
We can achieve 100% abstraction
using interfaces.
Two methods to achieve abstraction in Java:
1)Abstract classes
Abstract classes are
classes with abstract keyword.
2)Interfaces
Interfaces are the contracts that
we create with the help of
interfaces keyword.

If two or more classes are
closely related to each other
go with abstract classes
If two classes are not related
to each other we should create
an interface for that

Two methods to achieve abstraction in Java:

2)Interfaces
Interfaces are the contracts that we create with the help of interfaces keyword.

1)Prefer interfaces over abstract classes.
2)If two or more classes are closely related to each other go with abstract classes for example if we  have to create
a Lion class and Horse class we should go with abstract classes and should create an animal abstract class.
If two classes are not related to each other for example an Apple and a Cloth we should create an interface for that
look if we want to have a behavior washAble .
=======================================================
Encapsulation:
It is the forth pillar of OOPS it provides security and better control over the data of a class.
We create classes and inside those classes we create private fields and methods.
This methods are classes getter setter methods and we set and get the value of the class fields with the hepl
of these methods instead of

Eclipse vs Intellij
workspace vs project
project vs module
