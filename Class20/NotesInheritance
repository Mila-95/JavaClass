Constructors in Java:
Constructions in java are special block of code similar to methods that initialize
object of a class.
Rules:
1)They don't have return type not even void
2)Name of the constructor must be the same as name of the class
3)Constructors cannot have none access modifier like static final ect.
4)We can use access modifier like public private protected with constructor.
5)If we don't wright the constructor in the class a default constructor is provided by compiler
6)we can have multiple constructors in a class but their number of arguments sequence of argument
 of type of arguments should be different.
7)If we have multiple constructors then Java decide which constructor to call based on the parameter we pass
This keywords:
it is a reserved keyword in Java that we can use to refer to instance variable methods of constructors of a class
1)"this" keyword is used for distinguish instance variable with local variables
2) We can use "This" keyword to call the constructor of the class inside another constructor
3)We can use "this" keyword to call the methods of a class
Rules:
1)this() should be the first line inside the constructor
2)this() cant be use inside methods
