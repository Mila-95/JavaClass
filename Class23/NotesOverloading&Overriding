Method overloading in java;
When same method mane exist in the class but with different number of parameters or different type of parameters
or different sequence of parameters.
Advantages of method overloading
  1)Flexibility of having same name method in the class
  2)End user gets the benefit that he does not need to remember different method names.
  Rules:
  We can overload the constructors
  We can overload static method as well
  we can overload the main method sa well
Method overwriting:
1)Method overwriting happens when we have the same name method in the parent
 class and in the child class.
 2)We can have only override a method if we have inheritance relationship between two
 classes
 3)we cant override the private methods because they don't participate in inheritance
