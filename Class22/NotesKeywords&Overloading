Super Keyword;
super keyword like "this" keyword but it refers to the parent class object.We can use the supper keyword in 3
different ways.
1)To access the super class variable if we have same named variable in super class and base class.
2)If we hae same method names in the parent class and in the child class we can use
super keyword to access parent class method otherwise by default java refers to the class child class methods.
3)As constructors don't participate in inheritance we can ude super() to call the constructors from the parent class.
Rules:
1)If we have a constructor in the parent class that takes two argument we must have a constructor inside the child class
that at least takes those two arguments.
2)We cant use this() and super() inside the same constructor.

Method overloading in Java:
If we hava same name methods in the class with different number of parameters or different sequence of parameters
or different data types of the parameters it is called methods overloading.

  add(int number,int number2){
