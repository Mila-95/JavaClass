Recap
Access Modifiers in Java:

Access modifiers allow us to control the visibility of access(fields constructor etc.)and classes itself in Java.
There are 4 access levels and there are 3 keywords that we used to define these
accrss level fourth level is applier when we don't use any access modifier keyword.
levels from most restricted to less restricted are
1)private  (keyword is also private)
2)default  (no keyword means default access level)
3)protected (keyword also protected)
4)public (keyword ia also protected)
Rules:
1)we should always prefer private assess modifier for the field.Because fields contain the data and the methods of
 your class might use that data to perform some task if we don't perform sanity checks(make sure everything working fine) before settings the values to
 these fields our classes and methods might misbehave also the access of the data should be restricted so that not
 every one can access the data.
 2)we cant use access modifiers with local variables

Constructors (is block of code)
Constructors in Java allowed us to set us the value of the fields of the class.
