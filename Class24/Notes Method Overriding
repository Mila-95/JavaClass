Method Overriding in Java:
Methods overriding happens when we have same  methods name and parameters in parent and child classes
Benefits
1) If we don't like something in parent class we can rewritings.
2)Same method can act differently depending upon the object on with we call it.
Rules:
1)without inheritance method overriding is not possible.
2)method signature should be same in parent class and child class.
3)if something does participate in inheritance we cant overriding.
If we participate with constructor and private method we cannot override
4)we can increase the visibility in the child classes but we cant decree it
for example we can go from default or protected to public but we cant do the reverse
5)We cannot override the static method but we can redeclare.
For example Main Method cant be overwritten as it is static.
6)We cant have different return type in the child class it must be the same as parent class
OOPS Main pillars:
1)Inheritance(code re-usability)
2)Polymorphism(1.Less code 2.Dynamic code)
3)AAbstraction()
4)Encapsulation()
